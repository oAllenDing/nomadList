                    See this chart on what's low and high radiation levels, EPA recommends keeping your additional exposure below 1,000 ŒºSv per year.
                    Radiation can affect DNA, telomeres, and odds of cancer. People are exposed to natural radiation of 2,000-3,000 ŒºSv a year.
                    Cancer risk is highly evident at 100,000 ŒºSv/year where 5,000,000 ŒºSv kills half of people within a month.
                    This calculation assumes all trips made are by plane, which is a limitation, although most trips usually are made by plane.
